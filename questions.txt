Q: If I am going to be making a simulation with cars, what are some attributes tht each car should have like dimensions, acceleration curve, top speed, braking intensity, etc.?
A: Here are some attributes that I think would be good to have:
- Dimensions
- Acceleration curve
- Top speed
- Braking intensity
- Turning radius
- Weight
- Color
- Percentage of speed as it relates to curves
- Percentage of speed as it relates to hills
- Percentage of speed as it relates to the speed limit
- Ability to maintain driving in the center of the lane

Q: What attributes should I give each section of the road?
A: Here are some attributes that I think would be good to have:
- Speed limit
- number of lanes
- width of lanes
- position and size of hazards


Q: What attributes should I give the simulation?
A: Here are some attributes that I think would be good to have:
- Time of day
- Weather
- Traffic density

Q: What file type should I use and what structure should I use for the road system, which I will use to make a visualization? I dont think I want to use json
A: I think that a csv file would be a good choice for the road system. The csv file would have the following columns:
- x coordinate
- y coordinate
- width
- height
- speed limit
- number of lanes
- position and size of hazards

Q: What library/tool/language should I use to make the simulation?
